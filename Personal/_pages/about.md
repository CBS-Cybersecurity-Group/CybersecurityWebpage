## What is the Cybersecurity Lab?

In the CBS cybersecurity lab professors and student assistants collaborate on a variety of cybersecurity research and projects. Our lab is a supportive environment where the focus is on learning, innovation, and addressing practical challenges in digital security. One of the key initiatives is the collaboration with the Danish Industry Foundation on the Danish Cybersecurity Championship (De Danske Cybermesterskaber). Additionally, the Lab focuses on hosting events for students who are interested in cybersecurity.

## Why is cyber security important?

In today's increasingly digital world, cybersecurity has become a critical priority. With the rapid expansion of technology and the internet, our personal, professional, and governmental data are more interconnected than ever before. This connectivity, while providing numerous benefits, also exposes us to significant risks.

Cybersecurity is essential for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. As cyber threats evolve in sophistication, the potential consequences of security breaches can be devastating. These include financial loss, reputational damage, and even national security risks.

For businesses, strong cybersecurity measures safeguard intellectual property and ensure the integrity of operations. For individuals, it means protecting personal data and privacy. For governments, it is crucial for the security of critical infrastructure and national defense.

In an era where data is a valuable asset, maintaining robust cybersecurity is not just an option; it is a necessity. It underpins the trust and reliability of our digital systems, enabling us to fully harness the benefits of technology while mitigating the associated risks. Investing in cybersecurity is investing in the safety and resilience of our digital future.


## What is CBS's role regarding cyber security?
