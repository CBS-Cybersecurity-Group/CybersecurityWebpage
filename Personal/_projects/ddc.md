## The Danish Cybersecurity Championship - De Danske Cybermesterskaber

[De Danske Cybermesterskaber](https://www.cybermesterskaberne.dk/) is hosted every year to select the Danish team for the [European Cybersecurity Challenge](https://ecsc.eu/) and spark interest in students for cybersecurity. It is a collaborative effort between many Danish universities to provide the CTF-challenges for the participants and workshops for beginners.

The CBS Cybersecurity Lab developed challenges for the competition in 2023 and 2024. It is planned to also contribute in the upcoming years. The past challenges developed at CBS covered topics like web security, forensics, and misc. The challenge difficulty ranged from beginner to medium.

Workshops provided by the Cybersecurity Lab were conducted on data analysis with R and a command line introduction.
